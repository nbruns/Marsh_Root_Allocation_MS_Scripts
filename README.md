This dataset and R script accompany the published paper **Bruns et al. (2024)** in *Geophysical Research Letters*. The data are from the first six years of a field manipulation of whole-ecosystem warming and elevated CO2 experiment (**Salt Marsh Accretion Response to Temperature Experiment, or SMARTX**) in the Smithsonian's Global Change Research Wetland (**GCReW**), a brackish, microtidal wetland site on a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay.  

These data were generated to understand how warming and elevated CO2 interact to structure ecosystem-level responses to global change, particularly carbon sequestration. The dataset covers **2017-2022** and includes:
- Peak annual aboveground biomass  
- Annual belowground fine root productivity  
- Porewater NH₄ for each experimental plot  

The overall experiment is replicated in two locations on the marsh:
- A **lower elevation zone** dominated by the C3 sedge *Schoenoplectus americanus*  
- A **higher elevation plot** dominated by a C4 species  

This paper and its data release focus **only on the C3 plot**.  

### Files Included:
- **`variable_descriptions.pdf`** – Provides variable descriptions for the data file  
- **`Bruns_et_al_2024_GRL_make_figures.Rmd`** – Contains model code and scripts used to generate all paper figures
